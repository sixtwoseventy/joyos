 * \brief Motor Outputs.
 *
 * The happyboard as 6 1.5A Motor drivers with current sensing capabilities.
 * Motors can be set to 3 possible states: \em drive, \em coast, or \em brake.
 *
 *  - \em Drive is the default state, used for any velocity other than 0
 *  - \em Coast is used when a motor is set to 0 velocity. This causes the motor to coast
 *          to a stop (the motor is not actively stopped).
 *  - \em Brake is used when motorBrake is called, and actively stops the motor by shorting the
 *          motor terminals.
 *
 * Each motor port has a current sensor associated with it, allowing the robot to sense the
 * current usage of each motor. Motor current increases proportional to torque and thus can
 * be used to sense when a motor has stalled (driving into a wall, other robots, etc).
